Given v(t) = -12t + 11, we can integrate it to find the position function x(t):
x(t) = ∫v(t) dt
x(t) = ∫(-12t + 11) dt
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + C

To find the value of C, we use the initial condition x(3) = 2:
2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C
2 = -54 + 33 + C
C = 23

Therefore, the position function of the particle is x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23. To find the position of the particle at t = 0, we substitute t = 0 into the position function:
x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23
x(0) = 23

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t = 0 is 23. 

<<<x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23, x(0)>>>To find the position of the particle at time t=0, we need to integrate the velocity function v(t) = -12t + 11 with respect to t to get the position function x(t). Then, we can plug in t=3 into the position function to find the position of the particle at time t=3, which is x=2. Finally, we can solve for x at t=0 using the position function.

Let's start by integrating the velocity function:
∫(-12t + 11) dt = -6t^2 + 11t + C

Now, we can find the position function x(t):
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + C

Since we know that x(3) = 2, we can plug in t=3:
-6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C = 2
-54 + 33 + C = 2
C = 23

Therefore, the position function is:
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23

Now, we can find the position of the particle at time t=0:
x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23
x(0) = 23

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t=0 is x=23.

<<<x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23>>>Let's integrate the velocity function v(t) to obtain the position function x(t):
x(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-12t + 11) dt = -6t^2 + 11t + C

To find the value of C, we use the initial condition x(3) = 2:
2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C
C = 2 + 54 - 33 = 23

Therefore, the position function is:
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23

To find the position of the particle at time t=0:
<<<x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23 = 23>>> 

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t=0 is 23.Given that the velocity function of the particle is v(t) = -12t + 11 and we want to find the position of the particle at time t=0, we need to integrate the velocity function to get the position function.

The position function x(t) is found by integrating the velocity function v(t):
x(t) = ∫v(t) dt

To find the position at time t=3, we have:
x(3) = ∫[(-12t + 11) dt] evaluated from 0 to 3

Now we can find the equation for x(t) and then evaluate it at t=0. 

<<<x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + C>>>

Substitute t=3:
x(3) = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C

Now we can solve for C by using the given initial position x=2 at time t=3:

-6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C = 2
-54 + 33 + C = 2
C = 2 + 54 - 33
C = 23

Therefore, the position function is:
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23

Now we can find the position of the particle at time t=0 by substituting t=0 into the position function:

x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23
x(0) = 23

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t=0 is 23.Given that the velocity of the particle is v(t) = -12t + 11 and we want to find the position of the particle at time t = 0. We know that velocity is the derivative of position with respect to time. Therefore, we can integrate the velocity function to find the position function.

The position function x(t) is the integral of the velocity function v(t) with respect to time:
x(t) = ∫(v(t)) dt

Integrating the velocity function -12t + 11 with respect to time:
x(t) = ∫(-12t + 11) dt
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + C

We can now use the initial condition x(3) = 2 to solve for the constant C:
2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C
2 = -54 + 33 + C
C = 2 + 54 - 33
C = 23

Therefore, the position function x(t) is:
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23

To find the position of the particle at time t = 0, plug in t = 0 into the position function:
x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23
x(0) = 0 + 0 + 23
x(0) = 23

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t = 0 is x = 23.
<<<x(0) = 23>>>The position of the particle at any time t can be found by integrating the velocity function v(t) with respect to time. This gives the position function x(t).

Given that the velocity function is v(t) = -12t + 11, integrating this with respect to time gives:

∫(-12t + 11) dt = -6t^2 + 11t + C,

where C is the constant of integration.

To find the value of C, we can use the initial condition x(3) = 2. Plugging in t=3 into the position function x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + C, we get:

-6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C = 2
-54 + 33 + C = 2
C = 23

Therefore, the position function x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23.

To find the position of the particle at time t=0, we simply plug in t=0 into the position function:

x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23
x(0) = 23

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t=0 is x=23. 

<<<x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23>>>The position of the particle is given by the integral of the velocity function with respect to time. 

So, the position function x(t) is the integral of v(t) with respect to t:
x(t) = ∫(v(t)) dt

To find x at time t=0, we need to evaluate the position function at t=0:
x(0) = ∫(v(t)) dt evaluated at t=0

Therefore, <<<x(0) = ∫(-12t + 11) dt evaluated at t=0>>>The position of the particle at time t is given by the equation x(t) = ∫v(t)dt + C, where C is the constant of integration. Since we are given the velocity function v(t) = -12t + 11, we can integrate this with respect to t to find the position function x(t).

Integrating v(t) = -12t + 11 with respect to t, we get:
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + C

To solve for the constant of integration C, we can use the initial condition x(3) = 2:
2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C
2 = -54 + 33 + C
C = 23 + 54 - 2
C = 75

Therefore, the position function is:
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 75

To find the position of the particle at time t = 0, we plug in t = 0 into the position function:
x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 75
x(0) = 75

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t = 0 is x = 75. 

<<<x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 75>>>The position of a particle can be found by integrating its velocity function. Therefore, integrating the velocity function v(t) = -12t + 11 will give us the position function x(t).

To find the position of the particle at time t = 0, we need to evaluate the position function x(t) at t = 0.

So, the position function x(t) is found by integrating the velocity function:
x(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-12t + 11) dt = -6t^2 + 11t + C

Now, we need to find the value of the constant C using the initial condition x(3) = 2:
2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C
2 = -54 + 33 + C
2 = -21 + C
C = 23

Therefore, the position function x(t) is:
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23

To find the position of the particle at time t = 0, we substitute t = 0 into the position function:
x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23 = 23

The position of the particle at time t = 0 is 23. 

<<<x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23 = 23>>>To set up the equation, we first need to simplify the expression inside the integral:

(-3) = -3

Now, the integral from 2 to 4 of -3 will simply be the area of a rectangle with a width of 2 (4-2) and a height of -3.

So the integral will be: ∫[-3 dx] = -3x evaluated from 2 to 4

Now, plugging in the limits of integration:

-3(4) - (-3)(2)

Final Equation: <<<-3(4) - (-3)(2)>>>To find the integral of (−3) from 2 to 4 with respect to x, we first need to find the antiderivative of −3, which is simply −3x. 

Therefore, the integral from 2 to 4 of (−3) dx can be written as:
<<<-3x|_2^4>>> 

This can be simplified to:
<<<-3(4) - (-3)(2)>>> 
Which simplifies to:
<<<-12 +6>>> 
And the final answer is:
<<<-6>>>Given the equation 2x = 4, the goal is to solve for x.

To isolate x, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 2.

Therefore, the equation becomes:
2x/2 = 4/2
x = 4/2

<<<x = 2>>>To solve the equation 2x = 4, we need to isolate x. We can do this by dividing both sides by 2.

Therefore, the equation becomes:
2x/2 = 4/2
x = 2

<<<x = 2>>>To solve the equation 2x = 4, we need to isolate x. 

To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by 2:

2x / 2 = 4 / 2
x = 2

Therefore, the solution to the equation 2x = 4 is x = 2. 

<<<2x = 4>>>The position of a particle moving along the x-axis can be found by integrating its velocity function with respect to time. Given the velocity function v(t) = -12t + 11, to find the position function x(t) we integrate v(t) with respect to t:

x(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-12t + 11) dt = -6t^2 + 11t + C,

where C is the constant of integration. To find the specific value of C, we are given that x(3) = 2. Substituting t = 3 into the position function:

2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C,
2 = -54 + 33 + C,
C = 23.

Therefore, the position function is x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23. 

To find the position of the particle at time t = 0, we substitute t = 0 into the position function:

x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23,
x(0) = 23.

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t = 0 is x = 23. 

<<<x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23>>>The position of the particle at a given time is the integral of its velocity function.

Given the velocity function v(t) = -12t + 11, we can integrate this to get the position function x(t).

x(t) = ∫v(t) dt = ∫(-12t + 11) dt = -6t^2 + 11t + C

We are given that the particle is at position x = 2 at time t = 3.

Substitute t = 3 into x(t):

2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C
2 = -54 + 33 + C
C = 23

Therefore, the position function is x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23

To find the position of the particle at time t = 0, substitute t = 0 into the position function:

x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23
x(0) = 23

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t = 0 is x = 23. 

<<<x(0) = 23>>>To solve the equation 2x = 4, we can immediately see that x = 2. 

Therefore, the final equation is <<<x = 2>>>.To solve the equation 2x = 4, we need to isolate x by dividing both sides by 2.

Step 1: Divide both sides by 2
2x/2 = 4/2
x = 2

<<<x = 2>>>Given the velocity function v(t) = -12t + 11, we can find the position function x(t) by integrating the velocity function with respect to time:

x(t) = ∫ v(t) dt
x(t) = ∫ (-12t + 11) dt
x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + C

To find the value of the constant C, we use the initial condition x(3) = 2:

2 = -6(3)^2 + 11(3) + C
2 = -54 + 33 + C
C = 23

Therefore, the position function is x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23. To find the position of the particle at t = 0, we substitute t = 0 into the position function:

x(0) = -6(0)^2 + 11(0) + 23
x(0) = 23

Therefore, the position of the particle at time t = 0 is 23. 

<<<x(t) = -6t^2 + 11t + 23>>>
